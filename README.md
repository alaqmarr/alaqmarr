💡 I build things that work, and sometimes things that *just look like they work*.  
🛠️ Currently tinkering with **Rust** 🦀 and occasionally breaking JavaScript for fun.  
☀️ Balancing between solar panels and server panels.  
☕ Powered by caffeine, curiosity, and questionable sleep schedules.

### 🎯 Fun Facts & Quirks
- Attends Dawoodi Bohra community events with tech in one pocket and ideas in the other.  
- Can debug code at 3 AM but forgets why he entered a room at 3 PM.  
- Writes code like he writes letters — with care, structure, and the occasional doodle.  
- Believes every bug is just an undocumented feature waiting for marketing approval.  
- Always chasing *the next shiny thing* — whether that’s a framework or a side project.
